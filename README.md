A sample application for the GA JS-320 class

## Why make this?
As an EIR at General Assembly for the JS-320 (Javascript) course, I wanted to
create a sample application encompassing some examples of what I have seen students
having some difficulty with.

## Goals

#### Personal
1. Provide a sample final project
2. Make use of the topics learned in class
3. Make use of topics students of class JS-320 inquired the most about

#### Application
1. Make use of the various Google Maps API
3. Make use of Firebase
1. Make use of Oath not supported by Firebase
1. Successfully Work with Oauth on the front-end without sacrificing a first-born

## Tools, SDKs and APIs used

Bootstrap as a CSS framework: because this is a JS class, not a UI class

SammyJS as a routing library: to provide an SPA ( Single Page Application ) expirience

Firebase: the database

Foursquare API: to fetch friends

Google Maps APIs: to map my friends

Oauth.io as sa no-oauth JS proxy to authenticate users

Bower: package manager for web libraries


## Gotchas
1. Originally I wanted to use Bower as a package manager but quickly realized not all libs
are on Bower. For example, the Google Maps API. I decided to use CDNs when ever possible.

## Topics of interest
1. Google Maps
1. Firebase
1. Foursquare
1. Bootstrap
1. Oauth.io
1. SammyJS
