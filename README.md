# Mini Games

An intro into game design, starting with javascript

## Why make this?

As a user experience designer, I think games are a fun and exciting way to put my skills into practice.

## Goals

#### Personal
1. Create a site/portfolio of ~very~ basic games using javascript
2. Create a repository I can add new content as my skills improve, even after this class period ends
3. Test the waters of game design

#### Application
1. Guessing game
2. Memory game
3. Pong
4. Tetris
5. Tic Tac Toe
6. Sprite animation

## Tools, SDKs and APIs used
1. jQuery (bc why not?)
2. gameQuery (build on jQuery, specifically for game functionality)
2. Bootstrap (for a CSS starting point, and responsive design)
4. Instagram API (to pull images for the memory game)
5. Giphy API (to pull images for the memory game)


## Gotchas
1. This site is still ~very~ incomplete... but something I plan to develop further as my skills improve
